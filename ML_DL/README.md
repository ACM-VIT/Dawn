# README

This file is written as a list of introductory tasks to be done. They will be added upon and links to implementation will be added as time passes. 
If anyone has more projects add it to this list.

1) Count number of coins lying on a table from a picture. (Assume the same coin)
2) Twitter Sentiment Analysis. Find a dataset and learn about relevant topics
3) Download the iris dataset and load it using PANDAS. Explore the dataset and look at Pandas syntax.
4) Find out if there is any way to visualize huge datasets (You can use the Iris one if you want)
5) Check out image thresholding and see if you can isolate a color from an image.
