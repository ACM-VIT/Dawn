# Projects 

This file is written as a list of introductory tasks to be done. They will be added upon and links to implementation will be added as time passes. 
If anyone has more projects add it to this list.
> Note that some are available in our repos or the internet. You can copy but it would be great if you dont. Either way youll be asked some basic questions. Learn. There is no other way.


## Basic Projects

- [] Count number of coins lying on a table from a picture. (Assume the same coin)
- [] Twitter Sentiment Analysis. Find a dataset and learn about relevant topics
- [] Download the iris dataset and load it using PANDAS. Explore the dataset and look at Pandas syntax.
- [] Find out if there is any way to visualize huge datasets (You can use the Iris one if you want)
- [] Check out image thresholding and see if you can isolate a color from an image.
- [] Try using web scraping and make a 'Word-Web'
- [] Retrieve text from amazon and make your own dataset of reviews. 
- [] Number recognition
- [] Handwritten text detection
- [] Article Similarity

# Medium/Advanced Projects 

- [] Basic emotion (happy/sad/neutral) recogntion
- [] Face detection. Go through all pictures in your folder. Make a new one called faces and *copy* all faces *only* there
- [] Recognize shapes 
- [] Recognize shapes after drawing them
- [] Face recognition. 
> Do not try this yet
- [] Get emails from the Gmail Api and perform sentiment analysis. 
> You probably wont find a dataset. Use the twitter one and see how well it works. Or even better. Make your own.
