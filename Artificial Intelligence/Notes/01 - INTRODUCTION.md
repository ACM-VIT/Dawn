# Definition
There are several ways of defining Artificial Intelligence, depending on how different people perceive the philosophy. 
Let's take a look at some "standard" definitions commonly followed.  
<br/>  
<i>In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, 
in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. Computer science defines AI research as the study of 
"intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving 
its goals.[1] More specifically, Kaplan and Haenlein define AI as “a system’s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn 
from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation”.[2] Colloquially, 
the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, 
such as "learning" and "problem solving".</i> ~ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Wikipedia</a>.  
<br/>  
According to <b>Blay Whitby</b>'s book <b>Artificial Intelligence for Beginners</b>,<br/>  
<i>"Artificial Intelligence is the study of intelligent behaviour in humans and other living beings and finding ways to engineer that 
intelligent behaviour in machines to make them perform more efficiently."</i> <small>(not the exact phrase from the book)</small>  
<br/><br/>

# Bottom line
From the above excerpts, I'm sure that AI now appears to be domain where machines (which are theoretically idiots) are made to behave intelligently. Now, though the idea of "inteligent" machines appears to rule out the theoretical description of machines (idiots!), you must focus on the word "artificial" in AI. At the end, these are non living, insensitive pieces of shi...uh...metal that are incapable of perceiving and processing real world data like living beings. They don't have a brain or CNS like us, so if the 21st century human isn't truly "intelligent", how can machines be? So it boils down to mimicing intelligent behaviour so as to make it easier to integrate the use of machines with the humanly life.

# But what is "INTELLIGENCE"?
Stephen Hawking defined intelligence as the "ability to adapt to change". If we proceed by considering this definition, then we stumble upon the words "adaptability" and "change". The essence of these words can be understood by relating to Darwin's theory of <b>Evolution</b> and <b>Survival of the fittest</b>. From these bases, I think it wouldn't be wrong to infer that intelligence is the characteristic of an entity by virtue of which it can do everything requied (adapt) to sustain its existence. When we try to fit this in the context of machines, it somewhat explains the need for AI R&D - as the need for computing arises, we need machines that are capable of something more than just following hard coded instructions, and this is the only way machines can continue to exist (survive) amidst us.<br/><br/>  

Intelligence exists in various forms: one is emotional intelligence, that helps us react suitably in a given situation - that thing that doesn't make us laugh when someone dies; another form of inteligence is the one that helps us in logical reasoning and math. So far, you've read quite a lot of combination of words that try paving the way to the meaning of intelligence. A good way to understand intelligence would be to contrast it with <b>wisdom</b>. In your everyday life decisions, you need some form of support in order to be convinced that your decision makes sense. You either get that support from your pre-existing wisdom or aquire it using your intelligence. This is pretty much how it is made to work in the case of machines. Since it is not possible to write instructions for every possible scenario that can occur in the world, we try to create a general set of rules that can be applied to deduce a solution when there isn't already one listed in the <b>knowledge-base</b> <i>(the computer's wisdom; knowledge = wisdom)</i>.

# Summary
To summarize this introductory note, I would like you to remember the following points that can be used to define Artificial Intelligence.<br/>
<ul>
  <li> Mimicing (natural) intelligence</li>
  <li> Trying to formulate generalized rules or find hidden patterns in data that can be fed to the computer in a discrete form to make it do stuff we would expect it to without us explicitly instructing it</li>
  <li> Building a knowledge base (essentially a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table</a>) of actions to be performed in a particular situation, by making the computer <b>learn</b>.</li>
</ul>
