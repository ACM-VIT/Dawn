# BASIC Prerequisite Knowledge/Skills for learning AI
<ol>
  <li> Ability to write and understand programs and algorithms.</li>
  <li> Proficiency in at least one programming language. This can be anything: C/C++, Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, etc.</li>
  <li> Ability to code in <b>Python</b>. This is because:
    <ul>
      <li> Python is used widely in the industry, so most AI codes you find on the internet are going to be in python</li>
      <li> Python makes it easy and quick to implement ideas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Understanding of concepts of <b>data structures</b> (lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash-tables) and appropriate <b>algorithms</b> (BFS, DFS)</li>
  <li> Statistics</li>
  <li> Differential Calculus & Algebra can be helpful (not too necessary to some extent)</li>
  <li> 3D Geometry can help in visualizing complex datasets and algorithms</li>
</ol>
