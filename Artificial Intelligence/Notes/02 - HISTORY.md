<h3>Before the "DAWN"</h3>  

Imagine I tell you to teach cosmology to a 4 year old kid who can barely talk. How difficult would it be? You know the answer to that. It is 
exactly the same level of difficulty that lies in trying to make a machine "fool proof" that's not capable of <b>understanding</b> a lot, or 
<b>learning</b>. Actually, it's not the machine's fault; it's us who're incapable of writing uncountable <b>if-else</b> statements required to 
make a machine capable of handling everything. This problem was seen by a group of British mathematicians back in the time of the second world war. A group of such people, that included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>, were given the task of deciphering German <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enigma</a> codes. They, like any other CS geek, were probably a little lazy and wished they could get a machine do the task. However, it was unimaginable at that time to get a machine do something that needed the application of (human) intellect, but the idea would not just die. This led them trying to think hard about ways to turn this into reality, and soon they found out the need for <b>pattern recognition</b>. This marked the beginning of what would become a revolution in the field of logic, Mathematics and Computer Science for decades to come.  
  
Years later, Turing wrote a paper named <a href="https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf">"Computing Machinery and Intelligence"</a> in which the question <i>"Can machines think?"</i> was raised for the first time. Let me tell you, people went nuts over this at that time. Some other notable things associated with Turing are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing test</a> and ACM's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">Turing award</a>.

<h3>The DAWN</h3>  
Unlike any other field of science, Artificial Intelligence has a starting date. In the summer of 1956, an American Computer scientist named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John McCarthy</a>, who was an assistant professor of Mathematics at Dartmouth College at the time, conducted a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop">workshop</a> for 8 weeks, with 10 people, to discuss the prospects of and lay down principles for AI research for the following decades. it was at this very workshop that the term <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> was coined. McCarthy is also known as the <b>father of AI</b> for coining this term.

<h3>AI success stories</h3>  
Throughout the final decades of the 20th century, AI continued to boom as a research field. The use of AI was starting to become the standard for automation in the industry. NASA used AI for the first time to automate the launch of a space craft, which became a milestone in the integration of AI and industry. Some other events that rendered spectators of AI speechless were a computer named <b>Deep Blue</b> defeating the then World Chess Champion <b>Garry Kasperov</b>, and a program called <b>IBM Watson</b> successfully winning the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!">Jeopardy</a>, among others.
