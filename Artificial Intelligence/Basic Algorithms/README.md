# BASIC AI Algorithms
<ol>
  <li> <b>MINIMAX</b><br/>This is a <b>back-tracking</b> algorithm that is widely used in games such as TIC TAC TOE. In this method, the AI virtually plays all possible movess and, considering the opponent will also play in the best way, determines which move will give it the most chances of winning. It is theoretically impossible to beat a minimax algorithm. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU9Ch59-4vw">Watch on YouTube</a>.</li><br/>
  <li> <b>N-QUEENS</b><br/>This one is a bit restricted to CHESS, but it's interesting. The challenge is to place <b>n queens</b> on an <b>axb</b> chessboard in such a way that no queen attacks another (standard rules of Chess apply). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU9Ch59-4vw">Watch on YouTube</a>.</li><br/>
  
  <li> <b>LOGISTIC REGRESSION</b><br/>This is a very basic data prediction algorithm. Based on previous data, an equation is obtained (multivariate linear regression) and ultimately fitted into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">sigmoid curve</a> to get a <b>binary answer</b> (i.e., true/false, yes/no). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIYKR4sgzI8">Watch on YouTube</a>.</li><br/>
  
  <li> <b>RANDOM FOREST</b><br/>This is a commonly used <b>clustering algorithm</b> that works well even when the dataset is substantially small. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM4uJ6XGnSM">Watch on YouTube</a>.</li>
