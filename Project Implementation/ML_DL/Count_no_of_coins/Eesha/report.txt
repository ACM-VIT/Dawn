Counting the number of coins using OpenCV

Reference Tutorial:

(they have a tutorial on counting the number of tetris blocks, almost the same logic)

*Faced an error in some images where even a tiny edge was detected as a coin, so used approxPolyDP to determine whether the contour was a circle or not.
(based on my data, length of the function was more than 10 for a circle, and less than that was an edge.)
