508,positive,@united thanks -- we filled it out. How's our luck with this? Is it common?

511,negative,@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
512,neutral,"@united I understand, but it's tough when there is no way to get to the airport w/o serious risk of an accident. It's a steep price."
513,negative,"@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock."

515,positive,@united thanks
516,positive,@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
517,neutral,@united why not? Is it a law or a policy?
518,negative,@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
519,negative,@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
520,negative,"@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!"
521,positive,@united follow me please this airline is beautifull â™¥

538,neutral,@united @CheerTymeDad Gee that's like almost caring about ppl more than $$.  Think I'm more int in having a trusted adult w/ daughter .
539,negative,"@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue."
540,negative,@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
541,negative,@united #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals A&amp;C. #Flyingainteasy
542,negative,"@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but..."
543,negative,@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
544,negative,"@united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB"
545,negative,"@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice."
546,neutral,@united that's right- with an overnight Miami.

553,negative,@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
554,negative,@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
555,negative,@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
556,neutral,@united thanks again for your concern. I will contact customer care upon our return from Australia.

559,negative,"@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a concern, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward."
560,negative,@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
561,negative,@united When will email address/username sign-on be available? It's been a while.
562,positive,@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?

566,negative,@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
567,negative,@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
568,negative,@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
569,negative,@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
570,negative,@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
571,neutral,@united 6533 ORD to DCA

576,neutral,"@united Cancelled Flighted our flight, didn't rebook us on added flight, now have to drive from a Denver to KC....thanks!"
577,neutral,@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
578,positive,@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
579,negative,@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
580,negative,"@united v upset with your disability  ""services"". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude."

586,negative,@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
587,negative,@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
588,negative,@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.

592,negative,@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
593,negative,@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
594,negative,"@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it."
595,negative,"@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did."
596,negative,@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
